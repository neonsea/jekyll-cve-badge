# Jekyll CVE badge

Generates a shields-like badge for a specified CVE. Automatically fetches the CVSS score from NVD and generates the badge accordingly.

It uses CVSSv3 by default. If the CVE is old and a CVSSv3 is not available, CVSSv2 will be used. The badge itself links to the corresponding page on NVD.

### Installation and usage

Add the following to your Gemfile's jekyll_plugins group:
```rb
gem "jekyll-cve-badge", :git => "https://github.com/neonsea/jekyll-cve-badge.git"
```

Run `bundler install`.

You can then use the tag `cve_badge` anywhere. For example:
```md
{% cve_badge "CVE-2021-31698" %}
```

### Notes

* NVD's API is slow, so posts will take quite a lot longer to generate. Not much I can do here
* Add a `cve-badge.html` in your `_layouts` directory for custom styling. The layout is passed the params `cve_id`, `cve_severity`, and `cve_score`

### TODO

* Add flag to just add the badge with no CVSS rating
